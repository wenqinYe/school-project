				<h1>All Play and No Work</h1>
				<p> The twenties are also known as the roaring twenties--and for good reason. The twenties were a time period of major economic boom for the western provinces of Canada. After the war, people wanted to forget about fighting and truly live life. Technological advancements coupled with this change in thinking of the consumer led to the consumer culture that we all familiar with today. People in the twenties started to buy things for pleasure rather than for necessity. Furthermore, marketers changed from advertising the features of their products to touting the emotinal experience one will get using their product; thus, creating desire with the consumer. </p>

				<p>The life of a family in the 1920s is not much different from a family in the present day. The beginning fo the consumer oriented culture in the 1920s laid the foundation for modern day consumerism. Just like how families today gather near the TV, families in the twenties gathered near the radio to listen to their favourite stations.

				The life of a family in the 1920s is not much different from the present. This is because Canada's modern day consumer culture stems from the roaring consumer culture of the twenties. </p>

				<h1>Increased Wages</h1>
				<p>Average worker's salary for production workers by the end of the year increased by 10%, while average office worker's salary increased by 20%. Furthermore, average worker's annual salary in Canada increased from just $2,366 to $2,940 in just 4 years (from 1926 to 1930). </p>
				<p>As the salaries of worker's increased, so did the fun. With extra money people could finally buy things for pleasure rather than necessity. this led to the boom in consumerism during the twenties, where buying in ever greater quantities and enjoying life was deemed the most important thing. </p>
				<footer>Data was taken from statistics Canada's census during the twenties. It is considered to be a primariy document because the data was collected during the twenties. Thsi data gives us insight into how propserous the twenties were, as we can see that salaries grew by an astronomical rate in a short period of time. This is a reliable source because the data is collected by the Government of Canada's, statistic agency. Thus, it is unlikely to contain ay deliberate misrepresentations.</footer>

			<section id="paradigmshift-slide">
				<h1>Paradigm Shift</h1>
				<p>The twenties was a period of a huge paradigm shift in consumer thinking. People thought started to buy products for wants instead of needs. One's status shifted from what they did to what they owned. Marketers took note of this and marketered their products as desirable things to consumers, often times touting the emotional experience of the product rather than how the actual product worked. This contrasts to how product marketing before the twenties was all about describing the features of the product, and the consumer uisng logic to determine whether or not they needed the product. Thus, buying was the result of gut feeling rather than logical thinking of whether or not the consumer needed product. </p>

				<h1>Major Technological Advancements</h1>
				<p>Major technological advacements occured during the twenties that made people's lives easier. 
				Durin this time perdio, expensive products were finally available to the middle class due to increased efficiences in manufacturing. This combined with the advent of the installment plan (where people for products in payments throughout the year) led to major increases in buying.</p>

				<h1>World Changing Grocery</h1>
				<p>Before the twenties, shopping was much different. Grocery stores were runned by mom and pop shops, and buying your weekly gorceries meant going to several different stores; this means going to the butcher to get meat, go to some other shop to get vegetables and finish at another local store to get bread.</p>
