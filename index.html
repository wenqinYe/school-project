					<h1>The Summary!</h1>
					<p>The twenties were a time period of major economic and social boom for the western provinces of Canada. After the war, people wanted to forget about fighting and truly live life. Technological advancements coupled with changes in consumer spending habits--due to increased disposable income--led to the consumer culture that we all familiar with today. It was a time people did and bought things for pleasure rather than for necessity, and a person's status was derived from their material possessions rather than from what they did. This was a huge paradigm shift in consumer thinking that lasted until the Great Depression--when the boom ended.</p>

				<h1>Fun and Funner</h1>
				 <p>The film shows people dancing and having a good time at a ball. It perfectly portrays the care-free attitude of during the roaring twenties when people wanted to forget about the war and live life to its fullest.</p>
				 <p>The video was taken by the Canadian Film Board. The date that the film was taken is not clear as it was part of a documentary that occurs 30 years later. Though, the reason it was created was for use in creating educational documentaries that would depict life at the time for future generations to see. The people in the film having fun reflects the culture of consumerism in the twenties where people went from doing things for necessity to doing things for pleasure. </p>
				 <p>This film is reliable because it created by a government agency whose sole purpose is to document and create films about Canada for future Canadians to see. Thus, it is unlikely that the scenes are fake or not of the time period. Though the depiction of the film may be questionable as the agency that shot the film is part of the Government of Canada and may therefore be taken in a way that boosts Canada&#8217s image, and may not necessarily reflect the actual feelings of the time period. </p>

				<h1>Buy Me Right Now!</h1>
				<img src=""/>
				<p>This poster is an advertisement for a Ford car in the 1920s with a fictional young man who is using a Ford car to run his own business. One interesting thing to note is that the young boy&#8217s smiling in the poster insinuates that the use of the car makes him happy. Thus, the message of the poster is clear; buy a Ford car and you will get a sense of happiness every time you use it.  This style of marketing, where advertisers try to convince consumers of the emotional feelings one will get from using the car, is reminiscent of the boom in consumerism during the roaring twenties and appeals to consumers&#8217 sense of desire rather than logic. </p>

				<p>The advertisement talks very little about the actual functionalities of the car. This is not an accident. Instead the poster talks about the pleasurable experience one will get from using the car.
There was a huge paradigm shift in people&#8217s buying habits; people starting to buy things for pleasure rather than need. The twenties were a time of huge increases in disposable income, and so people had money to spend on enjoying life, instead of just living life. Thus, this meant buying things that they may not have necessarily needed. Marketers during the roaring twenties exploited this change in consumer attitude to appeal to the consumer&#8217s desires rather than their logic. In the ad there are no discussions about the features of the car or how it works.
</p>
				<p>This source is reliable because it comes from the Henry Ford museum, which is a well known museum dedicated to providing historical information on Henry Ford. The audience for the car were for adults who might want to buy their sons a car. The information in the poster is likely to be exaggerated as its main purpose was to convince consumers to buy a Ford car; thus, one should not take the information in the poster as fact, but should instead look at the overview of the message conveyed by the poster.  </p>

				<h1>A Big Milestone In A Booming Decade</h1>
				<p>This picture depicts the 10 millionth ford Model T being built. This picture  captures the great boom in the auto industry during the twenties, as this is the 10 millionth car being, while only a decade ago the car was considered to be a luxury item. Cars were cheaper in the twenties and consumers flocked in numbers to buy them; cars were both a status symbol and an invention that made travelling much easier for people. Canadaâ€™s auto industry grew very rapidly as a result of the boom in consumerism in the twenties and was second only to the United States during the peak of the roaring twenties.</p>
<p>This picture was taken in 1924 by the Ford Motor Company to commemorate the 10 millionth Ford Model T being built. This picture perfectly symbolizes the roaring twenties and the great growth in consumerism in Canada. Furthermore, the car was one of the symbols of consumerism in the roaring twenties as it was seen both a status symbol that the middle class needed to have. The 10 millionth Ford Model T being built was the culmination of great advancements in technology during the twenties--namely in the assembly line--along with great amounts of desire for the latest and greatest by consumers.  </p>
<p>This picture was created and published by the Ford Motor Company.  The intended audience for this image is unclear, as it may have been used for internal use, or used as a photograph to show to the general public; nevertheless, the photo is unlikely to be doctored or fake as the Ford motor company has no real incentive in producing a fake picture. Moreover, this is likely to be one of the more reliable sources for photographs that depict auto industry as the Ford Motor Company was one of the companies that shaped the auto industry in the twenties.</p>
