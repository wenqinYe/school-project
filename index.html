					<h1>Tha Summary!</h1>
					<p>The twenties are also known as the roaring twenties--and for good reason. The twenties were a time period of major economic boom for the western provinces of Canada. After the war, people wanted to forget about fighting and truly live life. Technological advancements coupled with this change in thinking of the consumer led to the consumer culture that we all familiar with today. People in the twenties started to buy things for pleasure rather than for necessity, and their status was derived from their material possessions rather than from what they did.</p>

				<h1>Fun and Funner</h1>
				 <p>The film shows people dancing and having a good time at a ball. It perfectly portrays the care-free attitude of during the roaring twenties when people wanted to forget about the war and live life to its fullest.</p>
				 <p>The video was taken by the Canadian Film Board. The date that the film was taken is not clear as it was part of a documentary that occurs 30 years later. Though, the reason it was created was for use in creating educational documentaries that would depict life at the time for future generations to see. The people in the film having fun reflects the culture of consumerism in the twenties where people went from doing things for necessity to doing things for pleasure. </p>
				 <p>This film is reliable because it created by a government agency whose sole purpose is to document and create films about Canada for future Canadians to see. Thus, it is unlikely that the scenes are fake or not of the time period. Though the depiction of the film may be questionable as the agency that shot the film is part of the Government of Canada and may therefore be taken in a way that boosts Canada’s image, and may not necessarily reflect the actual feelings of the time period. </p>

				<h1>Buy Me Right Now!</h1>
				<img src=""/>
				<p>This poster is an advertisement for a Ford Model T car in the 1920s. It shows an advertisement for a cart and depicts a young man who is using a Ford car to run his own business. One interesting thing to note is that the boy is smiling in the poster which insinuates that the use of the car is what makes him happy. This style of marketing reflects the consumerism culture of the twenties, where people bought items for pleasure instead of necessity. Notice that no part of the poster talks about the actual features of the car but instead attempts to create desire by appealing to the reader’s emotions rather than their logic--which is what consumerism is all about. </p>
				<p>The description of the poster touts the ease and use of the car rather than the features of the car. This style of marketing is symbolic of the time period as there was a huge paradigm shift in people’s buying habits; people starting to buy things for pleasure rather than need.  It is reflective of the consumerism oriented marketing style of the roaring twenties where marketers would try to appeal to the emotional sense of the consumer rather than the logical sense. In essence, marketers were attempting to create desires for their products in the consumer. This represented a huge paradigm shift from when marketers tried to appeal to the logical side of consumers by touting the features of their products. Furthermore, during the twenties consumerism was growing to all time heights, with consumers buying products for pleasure rather than for wants. 
In the ad there are no discussions about the features of the car or how it works. In fact, the advertisement talks very little about the actual functionalities of the car and how it works but instead talks about the pleasurable experience one will get from using the easy to use Ford car. 
</p>
				<p>This source is reliable because it comes from the Henry Ford museum, which is a well known museum dedicated to providing historical information on Ford cars in the early 20th century. The audience for the car were for adults who might want to buy their sons a car. The information in the poster is likely to be exaggerated as its main purpose was to convince consumers to buy a Ford car. Thus, one should not take the information in the poster as facts, but should instead look at the overview of the film </p>

				<h1>A Big Milestone In A Booming Decade</h1>
				<p>This image depicts the 10 millionth ford Model T being built. This picture illustrates the prosperity during the twenties and the great boom in the auto industry during the twenties. 
Before the twenties, making over 10 million cars was unheard of as they were expensive products that only the rich could afford. However, during the twenties the automobile came down greatly in price, and the result was a frenzy of people buying cars as a status symbol. 
Canada’s auto industry  grew very rapidly as a result of the boom in consumerism in the twenties and was second only to the United States during the peak of the roaring twenties. </p>
<p>This source was picture was taken in 1924 by the Ford Motor Company to commemorate the 10 millionth Ford Model T being built. This picture perfectly symbolizes the roaring twenties and the great growth in consumerism in Canada, as 10 million cars being made was almost unheard of just a decade before, yet during the twenties became a reality. Furthermore, the car was one of the symbols of consumerism in the roaring twenties as it was seen both a status symbol that the middle class needed to have, while also being an affordable product that the middle class in Canada could finally afford --due to major advancements in the assembly line.</p>
<p>This picture was created and published by the Ford Motor Company.  The intended audience for this image is unclear, as it may have been used for internal use, or used as a photograph to show to the general public; nevertheless, the photo is unlikely to be doctored or fake as the Ford motor company has no real incentive in producing a fake picture. Moreover, this is likely to be one of the more reliable sources for photographs that depict auto industry as the Ford Motor Company was one of the companies that shaped the auto industry in the twenties.</p>
